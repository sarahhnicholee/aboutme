    <h1>Me time</h1>
    <div>
      I’m a dedicated wife, mother and a passionate foster mom to dogs. I’ve had
      the joy of fostering seven dogs and helping six of them find their forever
      homes in just the last three months. When I'm not volunteering at my
      childrens' school or assisting at adoption meetings, I love to further my
      education and expand my knowledge. Whether it's supporting my community or
      learning something new, I'm always seeking ways to grow and give back!
